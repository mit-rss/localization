    "**Question 1**. (**Motion Model**) Consider a deterministic motion model (no added noise) based on odometry information. The motion model, $f$, takes as arguments the old particle pose, $\\mathbf{x}_{k-1}$, as well as the current odometry data, $\\Delta\\mathbf{x}$, and returns a new pose, $\\mathbf{x}_k$ with the odometry “applied” to the old poses:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the poses $\\mathbf{x}$ are expressed in the world frame relative to some arbitrary origin (typically the map frame). The odometry $\\Delta \\mathbf{x}$ is necessarily a local quantity, and typically represents the measured change of pose between time $k-1$ and time $k$. Note that some systems provide the odometry as an absolute pose at time $k$ (this is the result of motion integration, which we know is diverging over time), in which case you can use the \"absolute\" odometry at time $k-1$ and time $k$ to get $\\Delta\\mathbf{x}$.\n",

    "**i.** Suppose you are given $\\mathbf{x}_{k-1} = \\left[0, 0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right]^T$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{k} = \\left[0.2, 0.1, \\frac{11\\pi}{60}\\right]^T$. Compute the odometry data $\\Delta \\mathbf{x}$ (expressed in the body frame at time $k-1$) that results in this transformation. *(Hint: review the geometry lectures on pose composition and inverse)*\n",

    "\n",
    "If you were to use this deterministic motion model in your particle filter all of your particles would end up in the same place - which defeats the purpose of having so many. When you build your actual motion model, you will be injecting noise into the function $f$ which will make your particles spread out as the car moves. This accounts for any uncertainty that exists in the odometry information. The sensor model will collapse this spreading of particles back into a small region."

We will use this likelihood to \"prune\" the particles as the motion model tries to spread them out. Particles will be kept if the sensor reading is consistent with the map from the point of view of that particle. The definition of this likelihood is strongly dependent on the type of sensor used - a laser scanner in our case. \n",

In order to perform these operations more efficiently, we will resort to discretization of the range values. Indeed you can think about the sensor model as a function that takes as input the actual distance $d$ and the measured distance $z_k^{(i)}$ and returns a probability. So rather than evaluating this function millions of times at runtime, you can evaluate it on a discretized grid of inputs $z_k^{(i)}$ and $d$ and store these values in a lookup table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we discretize in this way, for calculating $p_{max}$ we can set $\\epsilon$ to $1$ \"pixel\" or grid square of the lookup table. Thus the expression for $p_{max}$ with discretization simplifies to:\n",

This is essentially a stack of $n$ lidar messages which you are probably very familiar with at this point. There is one lidar message for each particle, which is the scan that would be seen from that point.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    poses = np.zeros((n, 3))\n",
    "    scans = self.scan_sim.scan(poses)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that when you are downsampling your lidar, you should make sure the `num_beams_per_particle` parameter in `params.yaml` matches the number of beams you are downsampling to - this parameter will determine the number of columns $m$ in the matrix returned by the `self.scan_sim.scan` call. For more notes on downsampling see the Tips and Tricks section.\n",

    "#### Converting from meters to pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "In your sensor model `evaluate` function, make sure you are converting the distances in your lidar observations as well as in the result of ray casting from meters to pixels!\n",
    "\n",
    "In your `params.yaml`, make sure the `lidar_scale_to_map_scale` parameter is set to $1.0$ for the 2D racecar simulator or the real car (it might be convenient to make separate launch files for running localization in the different environments that require different parameter settings). \n",

    "#### 2.3 Putting it all together: The particle filter\n",

    "\n",
    "From a very high level this will work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever you get odometry data use the motion model to update the particle positions\n",
    "- Whenever you get sensor data use the sensor model to compute the particle probabilities. Then resample the particles based on these probabilities\n",
    "- Anytime the particles are update (either via the motion or sensor model), determine the \"average\" (term used loosely) particle pose and publish that transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also consider how you want to initialize your particles. We recommend that you should be able to use some of the interactive topics in rviz to set an initialize \"guess\" of the robot's location with a random spread of particles around a clicked point or pose. Localization without this type of initialization (aka the global localization or the [kidnapped robot problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_robot_problem)) is very hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for determining the \"average pose\" of all of your particles, be careful with taking the average of $\\theta$ values. See this page: [mean of circular quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities). Also consider the case where your distribution is multi modal - an average could pick a very unlikely pose between two modes. What better notions of \"average\" could you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, publish this \"average pose\" as a dynamic transformation between `/map` and `/base_link`. This will allow you to visualize the location of the car on the map in RViz when testing on the real car! Note that publishing this transform isn't necessary when testing in the simulator; in fact, the simulator already publishes a ground-truth `/map` to `/base_link` transformation. To avoid conflicting with the simulator's `/map` to `/base_link` transformation, you should publish the \"average pose\" transform with `/base_link_pf` instead of `/base_link` when testing in simulation.\n",

    "#### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to debug the particle filter is by isolation. First, turn off your sensor model (don't ever resample). If your particles start out in a small location, they will begin to move together and slowly spread out as the travel distance increases. Remember in the absense of noise the motion model should exactly mimic the motion of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make some test cases for the sensor model. For example scans that are identical should have a very high probability. Scans that are completely different should have a very low probability. What other useful cases could you write tests for? Visualizing is super helpful. Use the [PoseArray message](http://docs.ros.org/lunar/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseArray.html)!!!!"

    "### 4. Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the algorithm must run in realtime with a large number of particles, an efficient implementation is a requirement for success. There are a few tricks you can use, primarily:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downsample your laser scan: you lidar has > 1000 beams but many of them are redundant. Downsample to ~100 for good performance (you could even try lower if you want). This will make the probability distribution over your state space less \"peaked\" and increase the number of particles you can maintain in real time (less ray casting).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also to make your probability distribution less peaked you could also try to \"squash\" your sensor model output probability by raising it to a power of less than one (1/3 for example) to make your distribution even less peaked. If you are confused by this paragraph, look at [4,5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't go crazy with particles: start with ~200. You can probably get your code running with thousands of particles but it will take some well crafted code to run in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that your sensor model and motion model don't need to run at the same rate! The motion model is probably much faster and over short periods of time it will accurately track the motion of the car. The sensor model can correct the dift of the motion model at a slower rate if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use ```ros2 topic hz``` to check the rate at which you are publishing the expected transformation from the map to the car's position. It should be greater than 20hz for realtime performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use numpy arrays for absolutely everything - python lists → slow\n",

    "\n",
    "For this part you need to refactor and tune your implementation from part B to work in your robot as well as the 2D simulation environment.\n",
    "To get started, you will need to adapt your solution to use the correct topics from the car:\n",
    "If you are using `/launch/localize.launch`, these topics and other parameters can be set in `/params.yaml`. You may also decide to make your own separate launch files for running your implementation in 2D and the real world, and set the parameters directly from the launch files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget about **rosbags** as a useful tool for both debugging and experimental analysis! Refer back to the Lab 3 handout for a reminder on how to use rosbag recording functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, don't forget that the `lidar_scale_to_map_scale` parameter in `params.yaml` $1.0$ for the 2D racecar simulation environment or the real car."

    "## Part D - (OPTIONAL Extra Credit) Bayes Filter\n",
    "The Bayes Filter presented in class in Lecture 10 consists of 2 parts:\n",
    "1. The prediction step: $$\\mathbb{P}(x_k | u_{1:k}, z_{1:k-1}) = \\int \\underbrace{\\mathbb{P}(x_k | x_{k-1}, u_k)}_{\\text{Motion Model}} \\mathbb{P}(x_{k-1} | u_{1:k-1}, z_{1:k-1}) dx_{k-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The update step: $$ \\mathbb{P}(x_k | u_{1:k}, z_{1:k}) = \\alpha \\underbrace{\\mathbb{P}(z_k|x_k)}_{\\text{Measurement Model}}\\mathbb{P}(x_k | u_{1:k}, z_{1:k-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above expressions, $x_k, u_k$, and  $z_k$ represent the belief state, control input (odometry) and the sensor measurement at time $k$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given** the previous belief state $x_{k-1}$, the motion model $\\mathbb{P}(x_k | x_{k-1}, u_k)$, and the measurement model $\\mathbb{P}(z_k|x_k)$, **derive the prediction and update formulas stated above**.\n",
    "To do this, you can rely on 3 basic probability principles:\n",
    "1. Bayes Rule: $$\\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}$$ which states that the probability of Event A given Event B is equal to the probability of Event A and Event B over the probability of Event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Law of Total Probability: $$\\mathbb{P}(A) = \\sum_{n} \\mathbb{P}(A | B_{n}) \\mathbb{P}(B_n)$$ which states that the probability of Event A is sum over the possible outcomes of Event B of the probability of Event A given a specific outcome of event B times the probability of that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Markov Property: $$\\mathbb{P}(x_{t} | x_{t-1}, u_{t}, z_{t-1}, ... u_1, z_0) = \\mathbb{P}(x_t | x_{t-1}, u_{t}) $$ which states that the current belief state is only dependent on the previous belief state and previous action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We define $u_k$ to be the action that moves us from state $x_{k-1}$ to $x_k$, so the sequence of inputs starts at $u_1$."
