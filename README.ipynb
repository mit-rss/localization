    "Determining a robot’s orientation and position in a known environment, also known as localization, is a critical problem in the field of robotics. As is common in robotics, this seemingly simple problem is surprisingly difficult, and remains an active research area. In this lab, you will solve robotic localization by implementing Monte Carlo Localization (aka MCL or particle filter). This is a challenging lab and we'd recommend starting early and moving fast. A good goal would be to get the particle filter working before break and use the time after break to tune and write up your report/prepare your briefing\n",

This accounts for any uncertainty that exists in the odometry information. The sensor model will collapse this spreading of particles back into a small region."
