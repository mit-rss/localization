    "\n",
    "Determining a robot’s orientation and position in a known environment, also known as localization, is a critical problem in the field of robotics. As is common in robotics, this seemingly simple problem is surprisingly difficult, and remains an active research area. In this lab, you will solve robotic localization by implementing Monte Carlo Localization (aka MCL or particle filter). This is a challenging lab and we'd recommend starting early and moving fast. A good goal would be to get the particle filter working before break and use the time after break to tune and write up your report/prepare your briefing\n",

Localization without this type of initialization (aka the global localization or the [kidnapped robot problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapped_robot_problem)) is very hard.\n",

    "As for determining the \"average pose\" of all of your particles, be careful with taking the average of $\\theta$ values. See this page: [mean of circular quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities). Also consider the case where your distribution is multi modal - an average could pick a very unlikely pose between two modes. What better notions of \"average\" could you use?\n",

    "Publish this pose as a transformation between the `/map` frame and a frame for the expected car's base link. In the simulator publish to `/base_link_pf` - otherwise it will conflict with the simulator which publishes the ground truth transformation from `/map` to `/base_link`. On the car just publish to `/base_link` - this will make your lidar scan line line up with the map which can be cool to visualize!\n",

Remember in the absense of noise the motion model should exactly mimic the motion of the car.\n",

    "\n",
    "The simulator publishes ground truth position so it is a great way to test your particle filter before testing it on the real car. Augment the odometry data with various types of noise and measure how your particle filter does compared to ground truth in a number of of experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Record several rosbags of random driving in the simulator. You can play these back while your particle filter is running for repeated tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "First try adding gaussian noise to the velocity and angular velocity given by the simulated odometry (`/odom`). Plot the error of the pose estimated by your particle filter versus the ground truth position for varying levels of noise. You can get the ground truth position by listening to the transformation between `/map` and `/base_link`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider making a node that adds noise to the odometry rather than hard coding it into your particle filter. What other types of noise could you add to better replicate the noise you see on the actual car? How can you improve the performance of your particle filter in the presence of this noise?\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these tests make sure that your position is being published in \"realtime\". This means **at least 20hz**. This may seem quite fast, but when you get your car to race speeds (~10 meters per second) the poses you publish could be as much as half a meter apart which will be tough for your controller to handle. Your publish rate is upper bounded by the speed of the odometry which is 50hz on the car."

    "### 4. Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the algorithm must run in realtime with a large number of particles, an efficient implementation is a requirement for success. There are a few tricks you can use, primarily:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ROS callbacks are not necessarily thread safe**. If your motion model and sensor model are updating the particle array independently (which they probably should) you must be careful to make sure they don't conflict! The python threading library can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downsample your laser scan: you lidar has > 1000 beams but many of them are redundant. Downsample to ~100 for good performance (you could even try lower if you want). This will make the probability distribution over your state space less \"peaked\" and increase the number of particles you can maintain in real time (less ray casting).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also to make your probability distribution less peaked you could also try to \"squash\" your sensor model output probability by raising it to a power of less than one (1/3 for example) to make your distribution even less peaked. If your are confused by this paragraph, look at [4,5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't go crazy with particles: start with ~200. You can probably get your code running with thousands of particles but it will take some well crafted code to run in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that your sensor model and motion model don't need to run at the same rate! The motion model is probably much faster and over short periods of time it will accurately track the motion of the car. The sensor model can correct the dift of the motion model at a slower rate if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use ```rostopic hz``` to check the rate at which you are publishing the expected transformation from the map to the car's position. It should be greater than 20hz for realtime performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use numpy arrays for absolutely everything - python lists → slow\n",
    "    - Use numpy functions on numpy arrays to do any computations.\n",
    "    - avoid Python for loops like the plague\n",
    "    - [Slice indexing is your (best) friend.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html)\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Use the smallest number of operations required to perform your arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Avoid unnecessary memory allocations\n",
    "    -   Cache and reuse important numpy arrays by setting them to the right size during initialization of your particle filter as “self” variables\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Identify your critical code paths, and keep them clean\n",
    "    - Conversely, don’t worry too much about code that is called infrequently\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Push code to Cython/C++ if necessary\n",
    "    -   But don't worry about this too much - we already did this for the ray tracing part.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Avoid excessive function calls - function call overhead in Python → slow\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Don’t publish visualization messages unless someone is subscribed to those topics\n",
    "```\n",
    "    if  self.[some_pub].get_num_connections() >  0 …\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   USE A PROFILER to identify good candidates for optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Make sure your TX2 is running in Max-N mode for best performance (more information [here](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2017/03/25/nvpmodel-nvidia-jetson-tx2-development-kit/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want an even faster (albeit more complicated to interface with) ray tracer check out [range_libc](https://github.com/kctess5/range_libc). This was written by RSS TA Corey Walsh and it is heavily optimized "
